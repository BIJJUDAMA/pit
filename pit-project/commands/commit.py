# The command: pit commit -m "<message>"
# What it does: Creates a permanent, uniquely identified snapshot (a commit object) of the currently staged changes.
# How it does: It builds a hierarchical Merkle Tree from the flat index to get a single root hash for the project's state. It then finds the parent commit, gathers metadata (author, message), and hashes them all into a new "commit" object. Finally, it updates the current branch file to point to this new commit's hash.
# What data structure it uses: Merkle Tree (to represent the project's file structure), Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (as each commit links to its parents, forming the history graph), Hash Table / Dictionary (the underlying object store)
